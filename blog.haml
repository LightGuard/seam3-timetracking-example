        # Getting Started with Seam 3 using the Time Tracking Example
        ## Introduction

        In this tutorial we'll learn about many of the Seam 3 modules by building an example from scratch!
        The modules that we'll be using are:

        * Seam Faces
        * Seam Persistence
        * Seam Catch
        * Seam Validation
        * Seam Reports

        As an exercise for the reader, a REST interface for the application could be built using Seam Rest.
        The code for this project is available at [github](https://github.com/seam/seam3-timetracking-example)
        
        ## Project Setup

        All Seam 3 modules are kept in an artifact repository, specifically the JBoss Nexus Repository. The
        easiest way to get started with Seam 3 is to add the desired modules to a maven project via the pom.xml. The 
        full [pom.xml](https://github.com/LightGuard/seam3-timetracking-example/blob/develop/pom.xml) is available 
        on github. Please refer to it to see everything that is going on. Throughout this tutorial we will refer 
        to sections of the pom in-line.

        Seam, as well as other JBoss projects, have a Build of Materials (BOM) pom that lists the dependencies and 
        versions of a particular release. This is the easiest way to get the correct jars and versions together 
        (we'll also be making use of RichFaces, so we're including it's BOM also):
      %pre{:class=>'brush: xml'}
        :escaped
                <dependencyManagement>
              <dependencies>
                  <dependency>
                      <groupId>org.jboss.seam</groupId>
                      <artifactId>seam-bom</artifactId>
                      <version>${seam.bom.version}</version>
                      <type>pom</type>
                      <scope>import</scope>
                  </dependency>
                  <dependency>
                      <groupId>org.richfaces</groupId>
                      <artifactId>richfaces-bom</artifactId>
                      <version>${richfaces.version}</version>
                      <scope>import</scope>
                      <type>pom</type>
                  </dependency>
              </dependencies>
          </dependencyManagement>
      %p
        There may be times when you need a newer version of a module than what is in the BOM. It's recommended 
        to use the maven properties to specify the version that will be used:
      %pre{:class=>'brush: xml'}
        :escaped
                <properties>
              <seam.bom.version>3.0.0.Final</seam.bom.version>
              <seam.faces.version>3.0.1.Final</seam.faces.version>
              <jboss.javaee6.version>2.0.0.Beta1</jboss.javaee6.version>
              <seam.validation.version>3.0.0.Final</seam.validation.version>
              <seam.reports.version>3.0.0.Alpha1</seam.reports.version>
              <jodatime.version>1.6.2</jodatime.version>
              <arquillian.version>1.0.0.Alpha5</arquillian.version>
              <richfaces.version>4.0.0.Final</richfaces.version>
          </properties> 
      %p
        Specifically we're using a newer version of Seam Faces, but we're also using Seam Reports and Seam Validation,
        which were not included in the initial 3.0.0.Final release of Seam.
      .note
        :maruku
          We're including jodatime because we're going to be using it directly, however, if you are using Seam with
          Glassfish 3.1, it must be included due to [GLASSFISH-16318](http://java.net/jira/browse/GLASSFISH-16318).
          This should be fixed in Glassfish 3.1.1 and 3.2
